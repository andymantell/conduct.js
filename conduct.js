/**
 * Main conduct function.
 * For a given array of media queries and callbacks, we will register a resize event and test the media queries,
 * applying and unapplying the relevant callbacks at each point.
 *
 * @param Array breakpoints
 *   Array of callbacks and media queries in the following format.
 *
 *     [
 *       {
 *         query: 'max-width: 600px',
 *         match: function() {
 *           // This code will run when this media query moves from an unmatched state to a matched state
 *         },
 *         unmatch: function() {
 *           // This code will run when this media query moves from a matched state to an unmatched state
 *         }
 *       },
 *       {
 *         query: 'min-width: 601px',
 *         match: function() {
 *           // This code will run when this media query moves from an unmatched state to a matched state
 *         },
 *         unmatch: function() {
 *           // This code will run when this media query moves from a matched state to an unmatched state
 *         }
 *       },
 *     ]
 *
 * Important note: The order that these callbacks appear in the array is important.
 * When resizing *up*, the callbacks will be unmatched and matched in an ascending order.
 * When resizing *down*, the callbacks will be unmatched and matched in a descending order.
 * The logic behind this is that you tend to want to unmatch a "desktop" breakpoint before matching
 * a "mobile" breakpoint.
